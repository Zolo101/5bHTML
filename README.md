# 5bHTML

5bHTML is a remake of the htwins [5b flash game](http://bfdi.tv/5b/) thats based on [battle for dream island](https://www.youtube.com/user/jacknjellify). It's in alpha right now so not everything looks and feels the same, so please keep that in mind before playing.

Hosted version: **v2.1 Alpha.**

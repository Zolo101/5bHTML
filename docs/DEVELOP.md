So you want to help me develop 5bHTML? Epic!!!!!!!

**Here are some things you should know before you help contribute:**

- Always make sure your on the latest commit, and on the dev branch before starting development.
- Make sure you are abiding with the eslint rules (VSCode does this automatically... I think). You can check if your code is abiding by doing `npm run lint`.

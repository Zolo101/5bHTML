ðŸŸ¥| Latest Dev version, these versions will not be on the [github page](https://zolo101.github.io/5bHTML/dist/), so you'll have to build them yourself.
ðŸŸ¦| Latest *""Stable""* version


# dev-24 ðŸŸ¥ -- 23/10/2020

Things since v2.1 Alpha:

- Fixed [#8](https://github.com/Zolo101/5bHTML/issues/8), which was when level names kept getting added after level completion.

- The character now moves accordingly to the mass of the sprite grabbed. (Heavy = slow)

- Added a dev-mode for better debug info. This is enabled if you build using `build-dev` instead of `build-prod`.

## Known issues

- You can still interact when dead.

- Finish sprites can hover in lvl 6.

- The dreaded [#7](https://github.com/Zolo101/5bHTML/issues/7) still happens... :@

# v2.1 Alpha ðŸŸ¦ -- 11/10/2020

- Fixed 5beam Explore intergration. Github was blocking the fetch requests because it was fetching a http url, which is unsecure. This has now been fixed as 5beam now uses https.

- Also added a 5beam-explore tutorial button.

- The bug with the ghost finish blocks has been fixed.

- The levelname text has been given its correct depth (It used to be behind the sprites).

# v2 Alpha -- 11/10/2020

## Major changes

- 5beam Explore intergration. Browse and play custom-made levels! You can upload your levels [here](http://5beam.zapto.org/). 

**Warning:** 5bHTML levels are very different to regular 5b levels, but it is easy to port one to another. Here is the [structure for the latest version](https://gist.github.com/Zolo101/36ae33e5dd15510a2cb41e942dbf7044). There *may* be a way to port them via a program in the future.

- Sprites are now in the game! They are pretty unstable though, specifically the physics.

- Terrain textures! Decoration will be done soon.

- Supports levels up to **level 6**.

## Minor changes

- Changed `WATCH BFDIA 5a` button to `WATCH BFDIA 5A.

- The Level Select screen now has a background similar to 5b.

## Dev changes

- `levels.ts` file **(no longer a json file)** updated to version 5 standards. See [this](https://gist.github.com/Zolo101/36ae33e5dd15510a2cb41e942dbf7044).

- Switched from 2d images to tilesets for the terrain.

- Typescript updated from `3.9.5` to `4.0.3`

- Eslint updated from `7.6.0` to `7.11.0`

- Webpack updated from `4.44.1` to `4.44.2`

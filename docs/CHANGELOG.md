- Revamped how levels are made. Levels are now made in [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/).

- The levelname text has been given its correct depth (It used to be behind the sprites).

## Major changes

- 5beam Explore intergration. Browse and play custom-made levels! You can upload your levels [here](http://5beam.zapto.org/). 

**Warning:** 5bHTML levels are very different to regular 5b levels, but it is easy to port one to another. Here is the [structure for the latest version](https://gist.github.com/Zolo101/36ae33e5dd15510a2cb41e942dbf7044). There *may* be a way to port them via a program in the future.

- Sprites are now in the game! They are pretty unstable though, specifically the physics.

- Terrain textures! Decoration will be done soon.

- Supports levels up to **level 6**.

## Minor changes

- Changed `WATCH BFDIA 5a` button to `WATCH BFDIA 5A.

- The Level Select screen now has a background similar to 5b.

## Dev changes
